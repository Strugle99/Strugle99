Hello, i'm @Struggle99 or you can call me rooney_mark 
i am mostly ineterested in contents that build my prograaming skills mostly in game development so i am lucky tohaave watch so good number of tutorials from youtube but thank God that i am here because i have passed very many issues.
I am currently learning a bit of mess thats in the languages of python, java script, c++ and many others.
I'm currently looking to collaborate on having full stack development and I will work as I can by the end of 2025 to be better in the programming languages i specialised in.
It is so easy to reach me just by my youtube accounts Programming Macros via Face book @rooney_mark and many other ways
